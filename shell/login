# From the bash manual:
# When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive 
# shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the
# file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for
# ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and
# executes commands from the FIRST one that exists and is readable. The 
# --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this
# behaviour.
