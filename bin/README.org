Some scripts and utils that I use with varying frequency. They are either used
directly by other domains of my environment or are not that important to be part
of a separate repository.

- =brightness= - script for controlling screen brightness on Arch Linux.
- =gifify= - script for converting video file to GIF. More information can be
  found in related [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2018-10-13-gifify.html][blog post]].
- =notify= - script for sending desktop notifications on Linux (via
  [[https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/][notify-send]]) and macOS (via [[https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier][terminal-notifier]]). Can be easily extended to
  support other notifications systems.
- =open_kitty= - monstrosity that I use on macOS to start [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][Kitty]] that enables
  better integration with [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai][yabai]].
- =patch_skhd_path= - used by =eru= to patch [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd][skhd]] PATH, so most of my binaries
  are available in =skhd= configurations.
