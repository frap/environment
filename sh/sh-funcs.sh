# Diff Files

#   My favorite diff tool is the =ediff= tool in Emacs, and little
#   function (taken from [[http://defunitive.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/invoking-emacs-ediff-from-the-command-line/][this blog post]]) allows me to use it from the
#   command line.

# f

#    Wrapper around 'find' that excludes some useless directories, like
#    =classes= and =.git= that ignores case, and does an /or/ around
#    every file name.

#    The first parameter can be a source directory to look for the
#    file(s), or you can do something like 'src/../some-file.txt' to
#    look in the 'src' directory for the files.

# SSH Force

#   According to [[http://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-disable-ssh-host-key-checking.html][this document]], we can ignore the /man in the middle/
#   attacks with a couple of parameters. Why is this good? Well, I have
#   transient hosts that often get rebuilt with the same IP address, and
#   editing the =.ssh/known_hosts= file is pretty obnoxious.

# Copying Git Repos

#   For some odd reason, I find I often need to copy the files from a checked out
#   branch from a Git repository, to a remote server, but /without the entire repository/.
#   By using =tar='s =exclude= option, we can do a pipe to =ssh=.

#   Parameters:

#   =$1= - The directory to copy
#   =$2= - The remote server (which can include any options to =ssh=)

# Directory Bookmarks

#   [[https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks][This script]] allows us to leave bookmarks to "popular" directories,
#   to jump directly there with a single name.

#   - s bookmarkname - saves the curr dir as bookmarkname
#   - g bookmarkname - jumps to the that bookmark
#   - g b[TAB] - tab completion is available
#   - p bookmarkname - prints the bookmark
#   - p b[TAB] - tab completion is available
#   - d bookmarkname - deletes the bookmark
#   - d [TAB] - tab completion is available
#   - l - list all bookmarks
