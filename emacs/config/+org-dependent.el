;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package defines simple functions for manipulating dependencies between
;; entries using `org-edna' package.
;;
;; There are two dependencies:
;;
;; - A blocks B
;; - B is blocked by A
;;
;; In order to add this dependency, use `+org-dep/add-blocker' function. It asks
;; for an entry (A) that blocks entry (B) at point and updates properties to
;; reflect that dependency:
;;
;; - To the entry A it adds a property BLOCKS with value ids(B_ID), or if the
;;   property already exists, just adds B_ID to the ids.
;; - In a similar fashion, A_ID is added to the list of ids under BLOCKER
;;   property.
;; - Additionally, entry A also gets a TRIGGER property that will try to update
;;   the status of entry B once A is completed.
;;
;; Blocked entry is automatically set to WAITING status when blocker is added.
;;
;;; Code:

3. Id of entry at point is added to the list under BLOCKS

4. A trigger is added to the blocker entry in order to
   automatically update entry at point once blocker is completed.
